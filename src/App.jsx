        React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you create reusable building blocks called components. These components make code cleaner and easier to manage. React uses a clever technique to update only the parts of the screen that change, improving app performance. With its focus on components and clear syntax, React is a popular tool for modern web development.
